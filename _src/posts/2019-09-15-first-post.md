My father had two unspoken rules about his books: 1) every time you go to a bookstore, you must leave with at least one book; and 2) you must never, ever get rid of books. His collection had begun before I was born and was growing until just weeks before he passed away when I was 32. To give you an idea...

... of just how seriously my father took his second rule my family moved from Louisiana to Saudi Arabia and back during the first 12 years of my life, and those books followed us -- 7,000 miles there, and 7,000 miles back -- thousands of books there, and even more thousands on the return trip. They followed us to every house my parents and my three siblings settled in.  A few years here, a few years there: The houses changed, but the library was as constant as something constantly growing could be.

Its hard to say when it went from "collecting" to "hoarding" -- but I would guess it was around my 16th birthday.  And you'd think that, at some point, someone would have asked him why he needed to keep every book.  I never did though.  If I had to guess though, I think his books were simply a part of him -- a form of distributed cognition.  He could look at a book and tell you the meta-story of where he got it, when, and why -- as well as the story actually written in the book.  The stories were his way of accessing the story of his own life -- in ways that only he knew.  I think that, for him, getting rid of a book would have been like getting rid of part of his mind, deleting a link to a cluster of memories.

When he died, my mother spent months selling those books -- carting them by the boxload to Goodwills and selling them on Ebay.  Those books that had been an organizing system for his mind turned into musty pages overnight.  At a few cents per book, the entire collection's worth totalled to a few hundred dollars.  Selling them wasn't about the money, though.  Rather, it seemed somehow fitting for my mother to scatter them to the wind -- like ashes.  I like to wonder sometimes where they went and who has them now.  When I close my eyes, I can still see those shelves.  I can remember them towering over me in my earliest memories.  But I can remember growing tall enough to reach the top shelf.  And I can remember the smell of paper and the dust in the air every time we put those books into boxes when we moved.

I want this blog to be like that library.  Whenever you see a book image, you'll know it's a link to a story.  I'll try to add at least one a week.  And above all: I will never delete one.
