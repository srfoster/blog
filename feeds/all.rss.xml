&lt;p&gt;As a teacher, I find myself eternally grateful to my own teachers.  This post is an attempt to say thank you to people I can never repay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stephenfoster.us/2019/10/teacher-thanks.html?utm_source=all&amp;amp;utm_medium=RSS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description></item>

&lt;p&gt;Consider learning that an ancient tome you found in a used bookstore was written as its author slowly went insane.
Knowing this would change the experience of reading that book!  I, for one, would like to know such &lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;meta-stories&lt;/span&gt; up front.  Some might prefer to learn it afterward.  But I think we can all agree that knowing the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold"&gt;meta-stories&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span style="font-style: italic"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; point generally enhances the reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stephenfoster.us/2019/10/story-meta-story.html?utm_source=all&amp;amp;utm_medium=RSS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description></item>

&lt;p&gt;My father had two unspoken rules about his books: 1) every time you go to a bookstore, you must leave with at least one book; and 2) you must never, ever get rid of books. His collection had begun before I was born and was growing until just weeks before he passed away when I was 32. To give you an idea of just how seriously ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://stephenfoster.us/2019/09/lost-library.html?utm_source=all&amp;amp;utm_medium=RSS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;More&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
