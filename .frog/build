I, for one, would like to know such <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">meta-stories</span> up front.  Some might prefer to learn it afterward.  But I think we can all agree that knowing the <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">meta-stories</span> at <span style=\"font-style: italic\">some</span> point generally enhances the reading experience.</p>\n\n<p>Examples of how important <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">meta-stories</span> are need not be as dramatic as a writer going insane.  Something as simple as knowing if a story is true or false is a huge part of the reading experience.  A false story whose <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">meta-story</span> claims it to be true is a lie &ndash; which bothers most people.  As it should.</p>\n\n<p>A similarly crutial <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">meta-story</span> is:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"SCentered\">\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Why?</span></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen a case where it detracted from the reading experience to know <span style=\"font-style: italic\">why</span> the author is writing to you.\nFor example, I feel quite cheated when I think I&rsquo;m reading an informational piece, only to find that it&rsquo;s actually trying to sell me something.</p>\n\n<p>Don&rsquo;t worry; I won&rsquo;t do that to you.</p>\n\n<p>I started the Lost Library because I have stories to tell &ndash; ones that are important to me, and that I believe can help others.  But chief among those stories are the <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">meta-stories</span> that say \"Why?\"  These are too critical not to tell.  They shape everything about the experience of reading.</p>\n\n<p>So I&rsquo;ll be honest, if I had to pick a single \"Why?\" &ndash; one \"Why?\" to rule them all &ndash; it would be:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"SCentered\">\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be around forever.</span></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s my polite way of saying that I don&rsquo;t know when I&rsquo;ll die.  My father&rsquo;s father died relatively young &ndash; in his 50s &ndash; after a year-long battle against cancer.  He outlived his own mother by only a year.  My father died of the same kind of cancer, also in his 50s.  Both of these events gave me a distinct awareness of the brevity and vulnerability that comes with being human.</p>\n\n<p>I am more than half-way to the age of 50 and have been for some time.</p>\n\n<p>[Family tree lang...]\n[Timeline lang...]</p>\n\n<p>[Choose your own adventure]\n[Possible links to other stories...

His collection had begun before I was born and was growing until just weeks before he passed away when I was 32. To give you an idea of just how seriously ...</p>\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>...my father took his second rule:</p>\n\n<p>My family moved from Louisiana to Saudi Arabia and back during the first 12 years of my life, and those books followed us across the Atlantic &ndash; 7,000 miles there, and 7,000 miles back &ndash; thousands more books on the return trip.  They followed us to every house we settled in.  A few years here, a few years there: The houses changed, but the library was as constant.  Or: as constant as something growing and evolving could be.</p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;d think that, at some point, someone would have asked him why he needed to keep every book.  I never did though.  If I had to guess though, I think his books were simply a part of him &ndash; a form of distributed cognition.  He could look at a book and tell you the meta-story of where he got it, when, and why &ndash; as well as the story actually written in the book.  The physical books were his way of accessing the stories of his own life &ndash; in ways that only he knew.  I think that, for him, getting rid of a book would have been like getting rid of part of his mind, deleting a link to a cluster of memories.</p>\n\n<p>The moment he died, this organizational system for his mind became nothing more than musty books.\nThe company that had employed him for over a decade failed to execute on his life insurance policy, sparking a legal battle that my mother is, years later, still fighting.  She was not able (or eager) to be solely responsible for the mortage on what was supposed to be their retirement home in Montana.</p>\n\n<p>So she spent months selling the collection &ndash; carting books by the boxload to Goodwills and listing them on Ebay.    At a few cents per item, the entire collection totalled to perhaps a few hundred dollars.  Selling them wasn&rsquo;t just about money, though.  Rather, it seemed somehow fitting for her to scatter them to the wind &ndash; like ashes.</p>\n\n<p>I like to wonder sometimes where they went and who reads them now.</p>\n\n<p>When I close my eyes, I can still see those shelves.  I remember them towering over me in my earliest memories.  I remember the day I realized I was tall enough to reach the top shelf.  I can remember the smell of paper and the dust in the air every time we packed books into boxes to move to a new house.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, my father didn&rsquo;t write.  He collected the writings of others &ndash; filtering them by an algorithm that I don&rsquo;t understand, and I&rsquo;m not sure if he was consciously aware of.  Books flowed into my life, onto the shelves.   And when he died, they flowed back to the world.</p>\n\n<p>We take 16 breaths per minute &ndash; and an average of 672,768,000 per lifetime.  But in a way, we also take just single breath in a lifetime:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"SCentered\">\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">We inhale stories from our world, becoming the hero in our own stories.</span></p>\n <p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Then we exhale.</span></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>It was by reading portions of that diverse, sprawling, eclectic library that my early mind took shape &ndash; a mind just beginning to inhale.  I can&rsquo;t think of a single thing I do today that isn&rsquo;t somehow rooted in the things I read growing up.</p>\n\n<p>As I continue the slow inhale, I&rsquo;ve begun to realize the value of writing &ndash; a way to make sense of the stories I read, hear, see, remember, and enact.  Of the thousands upon thousands of stories that have affected me, a special few have a sort of power in them.</p>\n\n<p>I feel compelled to write those down &ndash; both for myself and for others &ndash; filtering them by an algorithm I don&rsquo;t understand, and I&rsquo;m not I&rsquo;m consciously aware of.</p>\n\n<p>But I feel in my heart it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>"))))
